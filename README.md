Course that covered the foundations of computer systems, including reading in assembly and writing code in C, as well as understanding the internal mechanisms of computers


**Computer Science 208: Computer Systems**
Welcome to my repository for the Computer Science 208: Computer Systems course. This course provided a deep dive into the foundations of computer systems, emphasizing the understanding of low-level computing mechanisms, assembly language, and proficient C programming. The coursework included comprehensive projects ranging from binary conversions to creating a functional shell.

**Course Overview**
The course covered essential topics in computer systems, including:

Binary arithmetic and string manipulation.
The C programming language, focusing on memory management, pointers, and data structures.
Assembly language, providing insights into how high-level code is translated into machine-level instructions.
The workings of computer hardware, understanding how software interacts with memory, processors, and peripherals.
**Projects Overview**

**Project 1:** Binary String Converter
Objective: Developed code capable of converting binary strings to numerical values and vice versa, deepening the understanding of binary arithmetic and bit manipulation in C.


**Project 2:** 2048 Game with AI Solver
Objective: Implemented the popular 2048 game in C, extending the project by developing an AI that strategically solves the game, showcasing advanced programming skills and algorithmic thinking.


**Project 3:** Assembly Simulator
Objective: Created a simulator in C that interprets and executes a set of assembly instructions, simulating the behavior of a simple computer system, which enhanced my understanding of computer architecture and assembly language.


**Project 4:** Simple Shell
Objective: Developed a simple shell in C, capable of executing basic commands and managing processes, providing practical experience with system calls, process management, and the Unix programming environment.


**Technologies Used**

Programming Languages: C for the core projects and functionality, with assembly language concepts applied in simulations.

Tools and Environments: GCC for C compilation, GDB for debugging, and various Unix command-line tools for development and testing.
